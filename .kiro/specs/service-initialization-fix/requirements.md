# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The InkHouse application is experiencing a service container initialization error when users attempt to register. The error "服务容器未初始化，请先调用 Initialize() 方法" (Service container not initialized, please call Initialize() method first) occurs when clicking the register button, indicating that the ServiceManager.Initialize() method is not being called properly or is failing silently.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to register successfully without encountering service initialization errors, so that I can create an account in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the register button THEN the system SHALL successfully initialize all required services before processing the registration
2. WHEN the ServiceManager.Initialize() method is called THEN the system SHALL properly configure all dependency injection services
3. IF service initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and logging information
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL ensure ServiceManager is initialized before any UI components attempt to use services

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust service initialization with proper error handling, so that service-related issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ServiceManager.Initialize() is called multiple times THEN the system SHALL handle this gracefully without errors
2. WHEN service initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to the console
3. WHEN a service is requested before initialization THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message indicating the initialization issue
4. WHEN the application shuts down THEN the system SHALL properly dispose of all service resources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the registration process to work reliably across different application startup scenarios, so that I can register regardless of how the application was launched.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is launched normally THEN the registration functionality SHALL work without service errors
2. WHEN the application is launched in auto-test mode THEN the registration functionality SHALL still work properly
3. WHEN navigating from login to register window THEN all services SHALL be available and functional
4. WHEN the register window is opened THEN the RegisterViewModel SHALL have access to all required services
